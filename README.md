# ECE1512-2022F-ProjectRepo_YiyangShi_HsuanlingChen
This github repository contains the Project A for ECE1512 Digital Image Processing by Yiyang Shi and HsuanLing Chen. 

#About the project
In this project, we will be focusing on the setting of knowledge distillation as a model compression technique and to explore the practicality of transfer knowledge from a larger model to a smaller one in real-world settings. There are two parts of the project, 
(1)using conventional knowledge distillation framework as a model compression method for a digit classification dataset, “MNIST” 
(2)use of transfer learning and knowledge distillation to train a lightweight model for mimicking a pre-trained model from the clinical histopathology dataset, “MHIST”

This folder contains: 
1. Project_A_FAQs.pdf
2. README.md
3. T1.ipynb is a Python notebook for Task 1, showing how the teacher and student models are trained in the conventional KD framework. You will use this file to implement conventional KD for the MNIST dataset.
4. T4.ipynb is a Python notebook for Task 2.
