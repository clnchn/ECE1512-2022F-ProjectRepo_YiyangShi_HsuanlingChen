# ECE1512-2022F-ProjectRepo_YiyangShi_HsuanlingChen
This github repository contains the Project A for ECE1512 Digital Image Processing by Yiyang Shi and HsuanLing Chen. 

##About the project
In this project, we will be focusing on the setting of knowledge distillation as a model compression technique and to explore the practicality of transfer knowledge from a larger model to a smaller one in real-world settings. There are two parts of the project, 
(1)using conventional knowledge distillation framework as a model compression method for a digit classification dataset, “MNIST” 
(2)use of transfer learning and knowledge distillation to train a lightweight model for mimicking a pre-trained model from the clinical histopathology dataset, “MHIST”
